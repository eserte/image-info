    SVG parsing is now done by XML::LibXML::Reader, if available,

    @Image::Info::SVG::PREFER_MODULE

    Bundled Module::Install 0.91.

    Ceased a warning in the JPEG parsing code with perl 5.6.x.

    comment) chunk (RT #28054)

     a patch and file a bug report please.)

    which Perl version, release or product the license text refers to)
  * fix bug #29088 - Another hanging image
  * fix bug #29243 - Exiftext fields (like UserComment) not parsed correctly

2007-05-25 v1.25 Tels 127 tests

    + let string.t skip tests if Image::Xpm, Image::Xbm or XML::Simple
      are not installed (these would formerly silently fail)

  * reducing test.jpg with GIMP reveals a bug in EXIF parsing (not yet fixed)
  * MakerNote parsing:
    + add support for Panasonic cameras

      + Casio
      + Olympus
      + Fujifilm

    Release 1.01

    GIF parsing fixes from Ralf Steines <metamonk@yahoo.com>:

      - GIF 'DisposalMethod' and 'UserInput' now show proper values.

      - GIF 'TransparencyIndex' now appears in the info hash.

      - GIF anims with local color tables don't fail anymore
        (table size calculation bug).

      - Added: GIFs marked as 87a which contain graphics control
        extension blocks don't fail anymore, GIF is parsed anyway
        but $info->{warn} contains 'GIF 89a extensions in 87a'.

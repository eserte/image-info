This Perl extention allows you to extract information from various
image files.  In this alpha release we only support JPEG (plain JFIF
and Exif) and PNG.  Usage is something like this:

   use Image::Info qw(image_info);

   @info = image_info("filename");
   $hash_describing_1st_image = $info[0];
   $hash_describing_2nd_image = $info[1];

TODO:
   - add support for more image formats
   - standardize hash names (based on TIFF?)
   - rational class
   - Image::TIFF should not need to slurp
